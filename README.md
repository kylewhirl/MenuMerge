# How to Use
1. Select the shortcut you want to create a Menu for
2. MenuMerge will automatically create a Menu with icons and your chosen color scheme. You can change the resulting icons if you do not like the auto generated ones

# Known Issues
1. If you use variables in a menu item or prompt, it will be replaced with “<<Variable>>”. I will fix this if people enjoy this shortcut

# Future
In the future I would like add support for importing a menu as a json for faster creation of menus if people find this shortcut useful. 

I would also like to create a menu making shortcut that makes creating a menu easier and gives more options
